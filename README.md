Goddard
=======
Abstract
--------
The Goddard Project is developing the hardware and software of an autonomous robotic "smart" dog with a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Uno.

Summary
-------
The goal of this project is to design and build a robotic dog modeled after Goddard from the 90s TV series, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius. Sheet metal will be used for the body of the robot in order to keep the frame lightweight. The sheet metal will be welded together for structural support. Goddard will travel on 2 wheels powered by electric motors and 2 caster wheels. The robot will use a Raspberry Pi as its master device and an Arduino Uno in order to control the robot. All circuitry, microcontrollers, and motors will be hidden in order to preserve the integrity and appearance of Goddard. Essentially, Goddard will act and behave as an ordinary dog from barking, to playing fetch, to being a great companion and friend. Fundamental goals for the project include research, design, implementation and testing, as well as project evaluation. All members of the team will gain hands-on experience in electrical design, mechanical design, and programming. Successful project completion will yield a fully functional robotic dog that will be presented and demonstrated at the 2014 University of New Hampshire Undergraduate Research Conference.
